The corals of Kaneohe Bay started bleaching 4-6 weeks earlier than NOAA forecasts, and significantly earlier than the 2015 bleaching event. We believe that what is unfolding in the bay is unprecedented because peak water temperatures are not expected until late October. 

HIMB has pooled our expertise and resources to create an emergency program to monitor the bleaching event throughout Kaneohe Bay. The foundation of the program is large, high-resolution photomosaics of 30 reefs (see graphic). Layered upon these photomosaics are a series of observation efforts spanning multiple scales (see [Coordination](/coordination) for layers and layer coordinators).

The most unique feature of the bleaching response program is that we aim to measure these layers every 3-4 weeks in order to capture a “time lapse” of the bleaching event. We completed one full survey last week, which represents to bleaching onset time point. We plan to continue the program for two years in order to track post-bleaching recovery of corals, fishes and other important groups.

The program will identify resilience for future restoration efforts and can guide management decisions. For example, what are the corals, fish communities and reefs that fare better during the bleaching event and subsequent recovery period that can serve as models for restoration throughout the bay?
