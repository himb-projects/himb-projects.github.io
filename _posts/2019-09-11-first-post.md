We have set up this website as a means for people to keep up with the Kāneʻohe Bay coral bleaching event. We want our efforts to be as open and transparent as possible, and welcome any kind of participation large or small. 

HIMB aims to learn as much as possible from this event for (1) understanding the effects of bleaching at multiple scales, (2) how best to improve resistance and resilience, including restoration, for future events, and (3) how best to dovetail with historical data and existing monitoring efforts.

Updates on the project will appear as posts here. See the side menu for more information [about our approach](/about), program [coordination](/coordination) and other [resources](/resources).
