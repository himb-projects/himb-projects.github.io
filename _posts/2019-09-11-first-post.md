We have set up this website as a means for people to keep up with the Kaneohe Bay coral bleaching event. HIMB aims to learn as much as possible from this event for (1) understanding the effects of bleaching at multiple scales and (2) how best to improve resistance and resiliences, including restoration, for future events.

Updates on the project will appear as posts here. See the side menu for more information about our approach, communication and other resources.
